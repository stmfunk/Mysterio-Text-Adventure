  storyText: "You stand in a dark corridor. The path before you is seemingly endless,
    behind it is identical. A low sonorous hum permeates the space, disorientating
    you. You have no recollection of how you came to be here and only a vague memory
    of the last thing you saw. You have only to choices: forward or back...  \n\n1.
    Go forward \n2. Go back"
