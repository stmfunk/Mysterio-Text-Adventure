  storyText: "You enter a dark room. A pinprick of light grows into a glowing orb
    in the centre of the room. A booming voice fills the room, vibrating everything
    around and within you. \n\n\"YOU ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE GREAT MYSTERIO, ALL
    POWERFUL MAGICIAN AND SORCERER SUPREME! YOU HAVE TRESPASSED IN MY INFINITE MAZE
    AND NOW MY MASTERY OF SPACE AND TIME WILL TEST YOU UNTIL YOU ARE LEFT A HAUNTED
    WRAITH!\". The face vanishes in a loud flash, and darkness once again envelopes
    you. A dim glow illuminates the entrance to the maze.\n\n1. Enter the maze\n\n2.
