  storyText: "You crash into Mysterio, throwing him back against the wall behind
    him. His head smashes against the wall, shattering his crystal ball helmet. An
    elderly man with an angry yet terrified face looks back at you. \"How dare you!
    You have made a grave error!\" He squeaks in a nasal whiny voice. You see he
    is wearing a mic that must have connected to a voice modulator. With the fog
    he was floating on dissipated, you can see he was simply standing on a platform
    with two energy canons mounted beneath. Through a crack in the glass you can
    see the wall of a warehouse and fire exit. \"You are a pathetic fraud.\" You
    mutter and leave the building.\n\n                                                           
    Victory!\n\n1. Restart"
