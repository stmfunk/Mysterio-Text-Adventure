    and impenetrable. A ghostly voice echoes through the darkness. \"The rules of
    this maze are simple. Once you move forward you cannot turn back, the path will
    close behind you. As you move you must choose a path forward.\" A roman numeral
    glows golden on the floor. You have two paths to choose from.\n\n1. Take the
    left path\n2. Take the right path"
