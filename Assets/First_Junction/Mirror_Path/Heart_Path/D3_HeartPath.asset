  storyText: 'You balance carefully, one foot in front of the other as the wind buffets
    you constantly upsetting your balance. After walking in the darkness you see
    a pinprick of light ahead of you. As it gets larger, the wind intensifies, getting
    stronger and stronger with each passing step. You near the doorway when the wind
    overwhelms you knocking you sideways.You flail your arms, managing to grab the
    beam and wrap yourself around it. You crawl along the beam reaching the light
    and collapsing on the floor of the room. Shaken and exhausted you look around.
    The room is circular. A rope ladder leads down a hole in the centre. A razor
    sharp fan blade rotates in front of a vent directly opposite the entrance.


    1.
    Descend the rope ladder.


    2. Dive through the gap in the fan blade. (50/50
    death chance?)'
