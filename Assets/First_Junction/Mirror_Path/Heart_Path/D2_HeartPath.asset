  storyText: "The climb is slow and precarious. The path seems to get narrower and
    steeper as you climb, threatening to drop you to your death. Eventually the ledge
    reaches a platform surrounding the hole you emerged from. A spooled rope sits
    by the rim, tied to a poll. A staircase leads down into a gloom to the right.
    An opening in the wall leads out to a dark windy abyss; a narrow beam leads across
    with a swirling fog carpeting the floor far below. \n\n1. Descend into the gloomy
    staircase.\n\n2. Tentatively step onto the the beam."
