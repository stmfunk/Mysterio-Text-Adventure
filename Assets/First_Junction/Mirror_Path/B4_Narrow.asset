  storyText: 'The opening leads to a corridor with a jagged path with sharp turns
    blocking your view as it extends. You follow the corridor but as you venture
    forward the passage feels more and more constricting, become tighter and tighter
    until you are brushing your shoulder against either side. You come to another
    turn and the path ahead is too narrow to walk straight. You''ll have to shuffle
    sideways through.


    1. Enter the narrow channel


    2. Head back'
