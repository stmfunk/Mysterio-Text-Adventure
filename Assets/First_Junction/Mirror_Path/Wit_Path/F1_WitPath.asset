  storyText: 'You enter a small square metallic room. There are two doors ahead of
    you. Your own voice echoes metallically at you through the small space. "Through
    one of these doors the path ahead lies. The other will trap you in an eternal
    void." One each door black text solidifies. "One of these statements is true.
    The other is false. Choose now."


    1. "This door leads to your goal and the
    other to the void."
