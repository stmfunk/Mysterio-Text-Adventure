  storyText: 'The opening takes you to a triangular chamber with three mirrored walls.
    The infinite reflections stare directly at you seemingly studying you. They all
    point directly at you somehow, subtly mimicking your actions. In unison they
    whisper at you. "Now you must choose." Then in turn they say:


    1. "This
    path is bright and narrow. It is for the strong of heart."


    2. "This path
    is simple but gruelling. It is for the strong of will."


    3. "This path is
    short but challenging. It is for the strong of wit."'
